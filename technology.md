# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier, specifically the linear model and kernel ridge techniques. 

Our training data contains 1460 rows and 81 columns, and the testing data contains 1459 rows and 80 columns. 

## Dashboard
A frontend interactive dashboard will be a webpage hosted on JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
